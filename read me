 Rusty Bargain Used Car Price Prediction
Rusty Bargain, a used car sales service, is developing a mobile app to attract new customers. One of its key features is an instant estimate of a car‚Äôs market value. This project builds a machine learning model that predicts used car prices based on historical technical specifications, trim versions, and other car attributes.

 Project Goals
Build and evaluate regression models to predict car prices

Optimize for:

Prediction quality (low RMSE)

Prediction speed

Training time

 Dataset
The dataset contains technical details of used cars, including:

Vehicle type

Year of registration

Model

Fuel type

Gearbox type

Brand

Damage history

Price (target)

Unnecessary columns like NumberOfPictures and PostalCode were removed.

üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed
Data Preprocessing

Removed irrelevant features

Handled missing values

Filtered out unrealistic registration years

One-hot encoded categorical features

Split the data into training, validation, and test sets

Model Training and Evaluation

Trained models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM

Evaluated models on:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Prediction time

Training time

Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimized model parameters (e.g., tree depth, number of estimators)

Final Model Selection

Compared models based on performance

Selected the best-performing model for final testing

 Libraries Used
pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

lightgbm

Conclusion
The project concludes with a trained and tested model capable of providing fast and reasonably accurate car price estimates, suitable for integration into the Rusty Bargain app.
